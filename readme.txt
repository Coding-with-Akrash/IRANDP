## IRANDP – Intelligent Rule-Based Autonomous Network Defense Platform

IRANDP is a real-time cyber defense system designed to **detect, analyze, visualize, and automatically respond to network attacks** using rule-based intelligence and live monitoring.

This project simulates a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment with live traffic analysis, global attack visualization, automated containment, and forensic logging.
